## Meet `eloc`

A markdown presentation authoring theme

---

for presenters who

1. __focus__ on writing
2. present in a __concise__ style

---

#### "True __eloquence__,<br /> does not consist in saying great things<br/> in a sublime style,

---

#### but in a simple style."

_â€” Oliver Goldsmith_

---

**`npm i slidev-theme-eloc`**

```yaml
# slides.md
---
